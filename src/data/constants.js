      // I designed the EJS templates and followed RESTful routing for the courses feature, comments, and the Projects pages.
      // I formatted the individual project pages to seamlessly integrate Google Slides presentations.

      // I validate form and input submissions using Joi.

      // I reached out to @christina.m.armand to discuss completely redesigning the user interface of shofolio.com for more of a social media user experience.
